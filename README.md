# PhonePe-Pulse-Data-Visualization-And-Exploration
Welcome to the PhonePe Pulse Data Visualization and Dashboard Project! This project aims to extract, transform, and visualize data from the PhonePe Pulse GitHub repository in a user-friendly and interactive manner. The solution includes steps to securely retrieve data, process it, store it in a MySQL database, and present it in a live geo visualization dashboard using Streamlit and Plotly.

## Introduction
PhonePe is one of India's leading digital payment platforms, processing millions of transactions every day. The Pulse Data Visualization and Exploration Project aims to create a comprehensive understanding of this transactional data to provide valuable insights for the business and its stakeholders.

## Problem Statement
The PhonePe Pulse GitHub repository contains a wealth of data related to various metrics and statistics. The goal is to:

**Extract Data**: Clone the PhonePe Pulse GitHub repository using scripting to fetch the data and store it in a suitable format (e.g., CSV or JSON)

**Transform Data**: Utilize Python, along with libraries like Pandas, to preprocess and clean the data, making it suitable for analysis.

**Database Insertion**: Use the "mysql-connector-python" library to connect to a MySQL database and insert the transformed data.

**Dashboard Creation**: Build an interactive and visually appealing dashboard using Streamlit and Plotly to display the data.

**Data Retrieval**: Fetch data from the MySQL database and update the dashboard dynamically.

**User-Friendly Interface**: Provide at least 10 different dropdown options for users to select different facts and figures for display on the dashboard.

The solution aims to be secure, efficient, and user-friendly, offering valuable insights and information about the data in the PhonePe Pulse GitHub repository.

## Approach
**1. Data Extraction**
Clone the PhonePe Pulse GitHub repository using scripting to fetch data.
Store the data in a suitable format, such as CSV or JSON.
**2. Data Transformation**
Use Python, along with Pandas and other libraries, to manipulate and pre-process the data.
Clean the data, handle missing values, and transform it into a suitable format for analysis and visualization.
**3. Database Insertion**
Employ the "mysql-connector-python" library to connect to a MySQL database.
Insert the transformed data into the database using SQL commands.
**4. Dashboard Creation**
Use Streamlit and Plotly libraries in Python to create an interactive and visually appealing dashboard.
Leverage Plotly's geo map functions to display data on a map.
Create a user-friendly interface with multiple dropdown options for users to select different facts and figures for display.
**5. Data Retrieval**
Utilize the "mysql-connector-python" library to connect to the MySQL database.
Fetch data into a Pandas dataframe.
Use the data in the dataframe to update the dashboard dynamically.
**6. Deployment**
Ensure the solution is secure and efficient.
Thoroughly test the solution.
Deploy the dashboard publicly to make it accessible to users.
This approach harnesses the power of Python and its libraries to extract, transform, and analyze data. It culminates in the creation of a user-friendly dashboard that provides valuable insights from the PhonePe Pulse GitHub repository data.
